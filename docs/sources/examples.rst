Built-in Examples
=================

Real-time chat
--------------

The ``echo_cherrypy_server`` example provides a simple Echo server. 
It requires CherryPy 3.2.3. Open a couple of tabs pointing at http://localhost:9000
and chat around.

Android sensors and HTML5
-------------------------

The ``droid_sensor_cherrypy_server`` broadcasts sensor metrics to clients. 
Point your browser to http://localhost:9000 
Then run the ``droid_sensor`` module from your Android device using 
`SL4A <http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/>`_. 

A screenshot of what this renders to can be found `here <http://www.defuze.org/oss/ws4py/screenshots/droidsensors.png>`_.

You will find a lovely `video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baD-rShmZcM>`_ of this demo in action 
on YouTube thanks to Mat Bettinson for this.
