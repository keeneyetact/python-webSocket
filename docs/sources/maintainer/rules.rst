Coding Rules
============

Python is a rather flexible language which favors conventions over configurations. 
This is why, over the years, some community rules were published that most Python developers follow.
ws4py tries to follow those principles for the most part and therefore.

Therefore please carefully read:

- :pep:`8` that suggests a set of coding rules and naming conventions
- :pep:`20` for the spirit behind Python coding
