Browser Support
===============

ws4py has been tested using:

- Chromium 22
- Firefox 16

See http://caniuse.com/websockets to determine the current
implementation's status of various browser vendors.

Bear in mind that time is a premium and maintaining obsolete and unsecure 
protocols is not one of ws4py's goals. It's therefore unlikely it will ever support older
versions of the protocol.
